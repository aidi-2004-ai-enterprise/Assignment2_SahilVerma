### Performance Bottlenecks Identified

#### 1. Model Loading Time
**Issue**: XGBoost model loading occurs during application startup
- **Impact**: Contributes to cold start delays in Cloud Run
- **Measurement**: ~800ms model loading time

#### 2. Feature Preprocessing
**Issue**: One-hot encoding and DataFrame operations for each request
- **Impact**: Adds ~15-25ms per prediction
- **Measurement**: 40% of response time spent in preprocessing

#### 3. JSON Serialization
**Issue**: Response serialization for confidence scores
- **Impact**: Minor but measurable overhead
- **Measurement**: ~5ms per response

#### 4. Cloud Run Network Latency
**Issue**: Network round-trip time for cloud deployment
- **Impact**: Base latency increase of ~50ms
- **Measurement**: Consistent 50-80ms network overhead

### Optimization Recommendations
